## Shell

This is a simple shell made as a project during Operating Systems course at the university.

The template was delivered by the professor, only lines between `#ifdef STUDENT and #endif` were coded by me from scratch.

## Manual
make - compiling

make format - formatting all .c files

make test - launching tests delivered by the professor

./shell - launching the code itself

## Disclaimer
Format rules are very strict, modyfing the structure of the code may not be a good idea :)
